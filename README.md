# AlphaZero-Chess
This is a small project on building a chess engine which uses AlphaZero algorithm to learn the game and having Python as the main programming language. 

Depending on hardware, it will be a major decider on how fast it trains within a batch. The engine uses a graphic card as the main processing unit, so a good graphics card is recommended for this project. So the better the GPU the faster it learns. 
Training data is not provided, but it easily obtainable online. For this project, The training data was obtained from www.ficsgames.org/.
